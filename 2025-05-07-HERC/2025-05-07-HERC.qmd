## 

![](../img/UK-vs-US-housing-age.png)

## There is no screening for lead exposure in the UK. 

### 2018 National Screening Committee Report

> The volume, quality, and direction of evidence published since 2012 does not indicate that screening for elevated BLLs should be recommended in the UK. Several uncertainties remain across key criteria including: lack of evidence that elevated BLLs in children is an important health problem in terms of UK prevalence.

### 2019 Lead Exposure in Children Surveillance System Report

> There are no recent comprehensive survey data estimating how many children in England are exposed to lead.

### 2021 Public Health England (now HSA)

Public health intervention level for lead halved from 10 to 5$\mu$g/dl.

# 1. Background on Lead

## What's so bad about lead?

### Lead is a potent neurotoxin

-   Toxic whether inhaled or ingested: "mimics" calcium, disrupting all biological processes that depend on it.
-   Harms reproductive, hematopoietic, endocrine, renal systems.
-   Particularly harmful to **central nervous system**: calcium crucial for neurotransmission $\implies$ damage to prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, cerebellum

### Lead is most harmful at younger ages

-   Permanent damage to developing nervous systems.
-   Blood-brain barrier more permeable in young children.
-   Digestive systems of children more likely to absorb ingested lead.
-   Lead accumulates in bone and *stays there* even after leaving the blood.
-   Young children put things in their mouths (paint chips, soil); lead **tastes sweet**.
-   E.g. Roman sweetener/preservative *sapa* aka *defrutum*: concentrated grape juice boiled in lead vessels

## Didn't we get rid of all the lead?

### We largely stopped *adding* lead, but much remains in place.

### Leaded gasoline

-   Responsible for the overwhelming majority of lead exposure during 20th century
-   Phased out for cars between 1973 and 1995 in US; banned in 2000 in the UK 
-   Still used in fuel for small planes: AVGAS.
-   Soil near major roads remains contaminated.

### Lead paint

-   Ubiquitous in first half of 20th century; US ban for residential use in 1978; (mostly) banned in the UK in 1992
-   Likely the main exposure source today, after phaseout of leaded gasoline
-   HUD estimate: 20% of US homes with small children still have lead paint
-   Ingested, or inhaled in form of dust (EPA requirements for renovations)


## Lead pipes: it's complicated

<!--
### Past, Present & Future of Lead Service Lines

-   US banned lead service lines in 1986; EPA estimates 6 million remain today.
-   Locations of lead service lines often unknown: statistical modeling.
-   Chicago: greatest number of lead service lines of any city in the US (400,000 est.)
-   Illinois: plans to replace remaining lead service lines over 50 years.
-->

### It depends on the water

-   **Scale**: plaque on inside of pipes that prevents lead from leaching into water.
-   Water hardness (mineral content) tends to increase development of scale.
-   Phosphates can be added to artificially create scale: compounds bind to lead.
-   U-shaped relationship: water pH and lead solubility
-   (pH $6 \uparrow 7$) $\implies$ (water-lead $\downarrow$) 50 to 90%, depending on above.

### DC 2002; Flint Michigan 2014

-   Changes in water sources/treatment $\implies$ sudden corrosion of protective plaque.
-   High levels of lead flush into the water supply (need to test at the tap)

## Measuring Lead Exposure 

### Blood Lead Levels (BLLs)

-   BLLs, either venous or capillary (finger prick), proxy for lead exposure.
-   Measured in micrograms per decliter ($\mu$g/dl)
-   Best we can do, but not ideal:
    -   Half life of lead in blood $\approx 36$ days: "instantaneous" versus cumulative exposure
    -   Venous tests are more accurate, but still noisy: measurement error

### Screening in the US

-   National Health and Nutrition Evaluation Survey (NHANES): venous BLLs, representative cross-section
-   Various screening programs run by the states
-   Federal guidelines mandate screening of all children on Medicaid at ages 1 and 2.
-   Some states have *de jure* universal screening; others have targeted screening

## Blood Lead Levels (BLLs): how high is too high?

-   1991-2012 CDC considered BLL $\geq 10$ *elevated*; since 2012 BLL $\geq 5$
-   Essentially arbitrary: 97.5%-tile, most children no longer exposed to lead
-   "No safe level of lead" but "the dose makes the poison" and BLLs have declined
-   Clear **symptoms** of lead poisoning (anemia) and acute harm: BLL $\geq$ 40 $\mu$g/dl
-   Permanent damage at levels too low to observe symptoms, e.g. lower IQ.

### Aizer & Currie (2018; AEJ Applied)
Lower BLLs explain 75% of decline in school suspensions from 1994-2015 in RI

### Aizer, Currie, Simon & Vivier (2019; ReStat)
Low levels of lead (BLL $\leq$ 5) have a discernible negative affect on test scores.

### Groenqvist, Nilsson & Robling (2020; JPE)
Long-term effects on human capital and crime from low doses of lead

<!-- ### Billings & Schnepel (2018; AEJ Applied)
Early interventions largely reverse negative effects for lead-exposed children.

IL Dept.\ of Public Health designates zip codes as "high risk" based on housing age and % of children below 200% of poverty line.


## How should IL target lead screening?

### Build novel dataset

-   Link lead tests to geocoded birth records for IL children born from 2010 to 2014
-   Merge with spatial characteristics that predict lead exposure: housing age, proximity to major roads, industrial lead emissions, etc.

### Impute missing BLLs

-   Rich set of individual and spatial controls, including all variables used to target.
-   Selection observables (into testing) is plausible here
-   Flexible machine learning models, tuned/evaluated with novel policy-relevant loss.

### Policy Experiments

-   How many children with elevated BLLs are missed by current screening?
-   Can we reliably identify children who *shouldn't* be screened?
-   Can we improve on the "high risk" zip code designations for IL?
-   How best to target screening at the individual level?

## If selection-on-observables is outlawed...

-   Not completely airtight, but we go much further than existing work
-   Policy discussions of targeted vs universal screening often assume BLLs *missing completely at random*, i.e. BLLs of tested and untested are equal on average.

## Novel Policy-relevant Loss for Model Tuning/Evaluation

### Naive Approach

-   Classification model to predict *elevated* BLLs: $1(\text{BLL}\geq 5)$ or 10.
-   How to weigh false positive against false negatives?
-   Is a BLL of 4.5 that you classify as "elevated" really a false positive?
-   Much worse to classify a BLL of 20 as "not elevated" than a BLL of 5.5
-   Cutoff of 5 or 10 is essentially arbitrary; why not 7?

### Our Approach

-   Prefer to identify children with higher BLL before those with lower BLLs.
-   Score BLLs based on the *harms* they cause in dollars: *averted cost*
-   Targeting function $r(X_i)$: ranks children based on observed covariates $X_i$.
-   If you plan to screen $n$ children, choose those with highest $r(X_i)$.
-   Evaluate $r(\cdot)$ by comparing its *total* averted cost to infeasible optimum that perfectly ranks children from highest to lowest BLL.
-   Develop cost-weighted targeting efficiency (CWTE) for tuning and evaluation.

-   The untested are, on average, lower risk than the tested: targeting works
-   Estimate 6600 missed cases relative to 18,000 detected cases
-   Over 80% of missed cases *should have been tested* under status quo: high risk
-   Model-based targeted screening superior to status quo and "universal" screening

## Phase I: Recruiting / Study Participation Decision 

### Research Questions
- How do LSOA characteristics predict response rates?
- Randomized Controlled trial: test alternative outreach messages

### Personalized Risk Information

-   Merged EPC certificates for Leeds with residential addresses
-   Gives us age of 250k properties (out of $\approx$ 373k)
-   "Our records indicate that your home was built before XXXX so it might have lead paint or pipes. Taking part can help you learn if these affect your child's health."

### Lead Exposure Sources

-   "Lead can be found in various products including XXXX. Taking part can help you learn if any of these affect your child."


## Phase II: Collecting Blood Samples 

Baseline survey & census: choose probs of sending each household a kit (2000 to 500)

35 GBP for returned sample / midline survey; 10 GBP for experience survey


## Phase II: Collecting Blood Samples 

### Research Questions

- Who returns the blood test kits?
- What fraction of returned kits are a usable sample?
- What are the BLLs of the returned kits?
- Randomized controlled trial: vary the contents of the kit
- Survey: barriers to participation, experience with the kit, etc.
